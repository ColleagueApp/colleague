Colleague is a web application idea directly aimed at college students who want to make connections with other students professionally to work on projects together.

Colleague helps form connections between students from any college in the United States based on major, career interests, completed coursework, current school year and relevant factors. Each studentâ€™s profile will include information about their interests, experiences and career goals, as well as a place to post updates and share their thoughts and experiences. The posts might be things such as blogging, self-authored literature, sharing info about a new project, or cute pictures of dogs, etc.

In addition, students can also connect over schoolwork, fun projects, scheduled activities and events, all while building professional and social connections.

The purpose of Colleague is to remove the exclusivity barriers that precent students from different schools from connecting and sharing experiences, further enriching their college journey via collaboration and bonding.
